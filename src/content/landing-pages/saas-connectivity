## Secure connectivity,  without changing your network

Changing your network configurations to connect to SaaS providers is slowing down on-boarding and increasing risk. Replace network-level changes with direct, private connections over Ockam Secure Channels. 


Ockam works with your existing infrastructure, and runs alongside your application or database. Establish mutually authenticated secure channels, which enables trusted communication between systems.

## Connect from anywhere

Ockam is agnostic to network-level and cloud-specific features. That means no matter where your database or application is - on prem, multiple clouds, in a VPC, etc -  you have a single approach that works consistently.

## App-to-app trust

Applications that are handling sensitive data require more than encryption
to the "end". Where's the "end"? What's needed to meet modern data governance 
expectations are guarantees that the intended applications are exclusively the
apps that can participate in a sensitive message stream. Ockam moves trust to 
the application layer by building a mutually authenticated and encrypted 
communication channel between all of your apps.

## Trust your security team can depend on

Ockam's approach uses a series of existing and well established open source technologies and frameworks. The cryptographic and messaging protocols are publicly documented and the implementations are open source and available on GitHub

## Automated & regular key-rotation

Everyone hopes they never have a data breach, but to minimize the impact incase
the worst happens Ockam apps automatically and regularly rotate their encryption
keys. If a secret key is ever leaked the data at risk is reduced to the amount sent
in the small window of that secret key was active. Don't put your 
historical and future data at risk because rotating secret keys is difficult &mdash; 
it's built-in from the start.

## Data authenticity & integrity

The approach to mutual authentication of every app that Ockam provides results
in strong data governance guarantees around the authenticity and integrity of 
the messages moving through your system.
