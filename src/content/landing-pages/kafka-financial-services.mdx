# Can your Kafka broker or provider read your messages? 

Even if you're connecting to your Kafka broker over TLS, _message payloads are 
in plaintext and readable while in the broker_. For topics that include PII, 
sensitive data, or just connect to core systems this approach can fall short
of the stringent compliance and confidentiality requirements of many financial 
services companies.
