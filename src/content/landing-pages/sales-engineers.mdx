    title: Unique keys per identity
    text: Each consumer and producer generates its own cryptographic keys, and is issued its own unique credentials. They then use these to establish a mutually trusted secure channel between each other. By removing the dependency on a third-party service to store or distribute keys you're able to reduce your vulnerability surface area and eliminate single points of failure.

    title: Tamper-proof data transfer
    text: By pushing control of keys to the edges of the system, where authenticated encryption and decryption occurs, no other parties in the supply-chain are able to modify the data in transit. You can be assured that the data you receive at the consumer is exactly what was sent by your producers. You can also be assured that only authorised producers can write to a topic ensuring that the data in your topic is highly trustworthy.

    title: Reduced exposure window
    text: Ockam secure channels regularly rotate authentication keys and session secrets. This approach means that if one of those session secrets was exposed your total data exposure window is limited to the small duration that secret was in use. Rotating authentication keys means that even when the identity keys of a producer are compromised - no historical data is compromised. You can selectively remove the compromised producer and its data. With centralised shared key distribution approaches there is the risk that all current and historical data canâ€™t be trusted after a breach because it may have been tampered with or stolen. Ockam's approach eliminates the risk of compromised historical data and minimises the risk to future data using automatically rotating keys.

## Remove unnecessary network complexity

Asking your customers to make changes to their network and infrastructure 
configuration to connect to your product is slowing down on-boarding and 
adoption. Replace the bureaucracy required to make network-level changes with 
the excitement of seeing value from using your product.

Ockam works with your product's existing solutions such as PrivateLink of VPC 
peering, but removes the need for your customers to make changes to their account. 
Your customer runs Ockam alongside your app, establishes a mutually authenticated secure 
channel, which enables trusted communication between the systems.

Your customers can have your systems connected in minutes, not weeks.

## Multi-cloud deployments

Ockam's agnostic to network-level and cloud-specific features. That means no 
matter which cloud your customers are using, or if they're using multiple 
clouds, you've a single approach that works consistently wherever your customers
are. That includes other on-prem environments, data centers, or even a server 
that's under someone's desk.

## Trust your security team can depend on

Ockam's approach uses existing and well established open source
technologies and frameworks. The cryptographic and messaging protocols are 
[publicly documented](https://docs.ockam.io/reference/protocols) and
the implementations are 
[open source and available on GitHub](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam).

Also available is a published and independent third-party audit by
the security research firm [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com).

## Trust at the application level

Traditional solutions like peering, VPNs, and maintaining allow lists - 
network-level approaches that connect entire networks to each other. To reduce
lateral movement within the networks further controls are then applied. 

By elevating trust to the application level, Ockam provides
fine-grained access controls that map to actual business needs. There's no long-standing
assumptions about networks, and secure communication guarantees 
push beyond network perimeters and system boundaries &mdash; they're
established all the way through to the applications processing your data.

## Data authenticity & integrity

The approach to mutual authentication of every app that Ockam provides results
in strong data governance guarantees around the authenticity and integrity of 
the messages moving through your system.

## Self-managed deployments

Ockam Orchestrator is a cloud-based fully managed solution that allows you,
and your customers, to be successful within minutes. With SLA guarantees and
publicly available historical uptime reporting, it's the preferred deployment
approach for the majority of customers. For those with specific self-managed 
deployment requirements, Ockam Business Critical provides options for running
entirely within your own VPC or on-prem.
