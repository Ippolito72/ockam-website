# Security should be a starting point, not a destination

Have you been operating in a mode where security assessments are happen late
in a project? Any problems that are identified suddenly create uncomfortable 
trade-offs: delay project delivery to ensure all the issues are resolved, or 
make pragmatic compromises on security/compliance posture that you need to
prioritize fixing later.

### Ockam is about empowering teams to build solutions that are secure-by-design.

Give your teams the tools that ensure systems are built securely from the very
beginning. Ockam's approach of "virtual adjacency" means your teams 
can build complicated distributed service architectures, but with a developer
experience that's as simple as having everything on `localhost`. And because
Ockam works across any multiple transport layers and network topologies your 
security team doesn't need to independently audit a multitude of complicated 
solutions. It's one approach, everywhere.
