    title: A solution developers will love
    text: Ockam was built by developers for developers. We're one of the most popular and fastest growing open source security project and community.
  - icon: globe
    title: Anywhere, everywhere
    text: Our approach works through networks, protocols, and clouds. On-prem, across clouds, TCP, bluetooth... it even works through asynchronous messaging systems such as Apache Kafka!

    title: Identity & Attribute Based Access Control
    text: Authorization to even establish a route to other services is tied to the unique identity of the client requesting access, which is both more flexible in terms of supporting modern and often dynamic deployment approaches and also more clearly aligns with your intentions around access controls. If the client is able to establish trust that they are who they say they are then they are able to route their packets to the database. Contrast that to historical approaches with _permanent_ access decisions based on assumptions about the remote network (e.g. is this request coming from an IP addess we have pre-authorized?). This is in addition to the authentication and authorization controls your services may already be providing, which will continue to work as they always have.

    text: No more worrying about centralized certificate management, rotating certificates before they expire, and the delicate act of rolling those updates out across your organization.

# Data is most valuable, and vulnerable, when it's moving

Have you been trying to help unlock the value of data that is hidden by
access control rules and network topologies that prevent it from getting to
where it is valuable? Those controls are well intended, but they're also designed
for a previous world with different needs. 

### Ockam is about empowering teams to build solutions that are secure-by-design.

Give your teams the tools that ensure systems are built securely from the very
beginning. Ockam's approach of "virtual adjacency" means your teams 
can build complicated distributed service architectures, but with a developer
experience that's as simple as having everything on `localhost`. No matter where
your data is it looks and feels like it is local. And because
Ockam works across any multiple transport layers and network topologies your 
security team doesn't need to independently audit a multitude of complicated 
solutions. It's one approach, everywhere.
