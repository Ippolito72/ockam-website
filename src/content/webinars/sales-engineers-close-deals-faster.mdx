## Do your new deals get stuck in on-boarding or PoC stages because of network and infrastructure changes? 
## Are your customers struggling to configure VPC peering, PrivateLink, or similar solutions to connect to your product? 
## Would you close more quota if you had a solution that supported multi-cloud deployments?

Leaders consistently tell us that 30% to 50% of their PoCs slow 
down waiting trying to establish network connections. This adds two to four 
weeks of delay to PoCs and pushes opportunities into later quarters &mdash; 
resulting in longer sales cycles, missed forecasts, and unhappy customers.

Join this webinar to discuss the underlying reasons for this friction, and how 
you can take control of the situation. **Reduce the time it takes to resolve 
from weeks to minutes**. All without requiring any product or networking changes 
for you or your customers. 

Kick the New Year off with a bang, by closing those deals that stalled over the holidays!
