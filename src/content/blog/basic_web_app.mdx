[Ockam](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam) is a suite of programming libraries, command
line tools, and managed cloud services to orchestrate end-to-end encryption, mutual
authentication, key management, credential management, and authorization policy
enforcement &mdash; all at massive scale. Ockam's end-to-end
[secure channels](https://docs.ockam.io/reference/command/secure-channels) guarantee authenticity,
integrity, and confidentiality of all data-in-motion at the application layer.

Whether you're using a relational database, NoSQL, graph database, or something similar
you're probably storing data that you don't want to be directly accessible by people who
you don't want to have access to it. Let's say you place your database inside a private
subnet following best practices. While this does an effective job of sealing it off from
the rest of the Internet, the trade-off is the overhead of granting exceptions to that
policy.

With Ockam you don't have to get network administrators to update network access control
lists, security groups, or route tables to allow other machines to open a connection to
the database. Ockam allows fine grained control to be applied via [Attribute-Based Access
Control](https://docs.ockam.io/guides/examples/abac). And to restrict who can access the
database you can even [integrate with an external identity
provider](https://docs.ockam.io/guides/use-cases/use-employee-attributes-from-okta-to-build-trust-with-cryptographically-verifiable-credentials)
like [Okta](https://www.okta.com/).

In this blog post we will show you how you can use the Ockam command line interface,
[`ockam`](https://docs.ockam.io/#install), to connect a traditional web app to a Postgres
database, with minimal / no code changes. We are going to take a very basic Python Flask
app that simply increments a counter in a Postgres database, and move the connection
between the application and database to be through an Ockam secure channel.

## Our journey

Before we get started, let's take a look at at the steps that we are going to perform in
this blog post.

![Our journey](/blog/basic-web-app/our-journey.svg)

1. Install the Ockam application and create an Ockam project using `ockam enroll`. This is
   the first [prerequisite](#prerequisites).
2. Set up the PostgreSQL database. This is the second [prerequisite](#prerequisites).
   Also, configure an Ockam
   ["outlet"](https://docs.ockam.io/reference/command/advanced-routing) to the database
   server. We will learn more about this in the ["Connecting the
   database"](#connecting-the-database) section below.
3. Set up the web app (Python Flask). This is the third [prerequisite](#prerequisites).
   Also configure an Ockam
   ["inlet"](https://docs.ockam.io/reference/command/advanced-routing) from the Python
   app. We will learn more about this in the ["Connecting the web
   app"](#connecting-the-web-app) section below.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow along, please make sure to install all the prerequisites on a machine
where you plan on carrying out the steps below.

1. [Ockam Command](../../#install)

   - After successfully installing this prerequisite (using [`brew`](https://brew.sh/) and
   `brew install build-trust/ockam/ockam`), you will be able to run the `ockam` CLI app
   in your terminal.

2. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and libraries: [Flash](https://github.com/pallets/flask/), [psycopg2](https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2)

   - After successfully installing Python (using [`brew`](https://brew.sh/) and `brew install
   python`), you will be able to run the `python3` command in your terminal.
   - Instructions on how to get the dependencies (`Flask`, `psycopg2`) are provided in the
   [Python Code](basic-web-app.md#python-code) section below.

3. [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)

   - After successfully installing this prerequisite (using [`brew`](https://brew.sh/) and
   `brew install postgresql@15`), you will be able to run the Postgres database server on
   your machine on the default port of `5432`.  Please make sure to follow `brew`'s
   instructions on adding PostgreSQL to your path.
   - Make sure to run the PostgreSQL server using `brew services start postgresql@15`.
   - Then set a new password for the database user `postgres`. Set this password
   to be `password` (the Python Code below uses `postgres:password@localhost` as the
   connection string for the db driver). The following directions can help you set this
   up on Linux or macOS:
      * In a terminal, login to the database locally as the `postgres` user: `sudo -u
         postgres psql --username postgres --password --dbname template1`
      * Then type the following in the REPL: `ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'password';`,
         and finally type `exit`.
      * You can learn more about this [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12721095/2085356).

## The Web App - Python Code

The web app (written in Python using Flask) increments a counter in a Postgres database
and it fits in a single file. To start, create `main.py` file on your machine and copy and
paste the following code into it.

```python
import os
import psycopg2
from flask import Flask

CREATE_TABLE = (
    "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS events (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);"
)

INSERT_RETURN_ID = "INSERT INTO events (name) VALUES (%s) RETURNING id;"

app = Flask(__name__)
pg_port = os.environ['APP_PG_PORT'] # 5432 is the default port
url = "postgres://postgres:password@localhost:%s/"%pg_port
connection = psycopg2.connect(url)

@app.route("/")
def hello_world():
    with connection:
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            cursor.execute(CREATE_TABLE)
            cursor.execute(INSERT_RETURN_ID, ("",))
            id = cursor.fetchone()[0]
    return "I've been visited {} times".format(id), 201
```

In this script, we establish our connection to the database using
`"postgres://postgres:password@localhost:%s/"%pg_port`, where `pg_port` gets its value
from the environment variable `APP_PG_PORT`. When we run the script (instructions are
shown below) we will set the environment variable `APP_PG_PORT` to `5432` so at this point
it's simply pointing to `localhost` on port `5432`.

<Alert status='info'>
   Make a note of the `pg_port` variable. In production the port is typically loaded from an
   environment variable and not hardcoded into the source. But for this exercise we are
   setting the value in the script itself. We will change this value in the next steps when
   we bring Ockam into the mix.
</Alert>

Before doing any Ockam related tasks, run the Python script now by following the
instructions below:

1. You need to add following Python dependencies by running the following.

```bash
# Install flask.
pip3 install flask
# Install psycopg2.
pip3 install psycopg2-binary
```

2. To run this `Flask` app (`main.py`) run the following.

```bash
export APP_PG_PORT=5432
flask --app main run
```

3. To see it running in a web browser open this URL:
   [`http://localhost:5000/`](http://localhost:5000/).

If you're running a local Postgres instance then starting this Flask app will now show you
how many times you've visited it, storing each new visit in the database 🎉.

## Install Ockam

We will leave the database running on the default port and then do the following.

1. Add Ockam to the mix.
2. Update our `APP_PG_PORT` environment variable so that it connects to a new port (not
   the default one of `5432` where the Postgres database server is running).

The first thing we are going to do is run `ockam enroll`. Make sure that you've installed
the Ockam CLI by following the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section above.

In a terminal window, run the following command and follow the prompts to complete
enrolling into Ockam Orchestrator.

```bash
ockam enroll
```

This command does the following:

- It checks that everything was installed correctly by enrolling with Ockam Orchestrator.
- It creates a Space and Project for you in Ockam Orchestrator and provisions an
  End-to-End Encrypted Cloud Relay service in your `default` project at
  `/project/default`.

## Connecting the database

Next, let's setup a `tcp-outlet` that allows us to send raw TCP traffic to the PostgreSQL
server on port `5432`. We will create its corresponding `tcp-inlet` in the [next
section](#connecting-the-web-app).

Note that we are using an environment variable called `PG_PORT`
here and not `APP_PG_PORT` which is used in our `main.py` script. And then let's create a
relay in our default Orchestrator project.

```bash
export PG_PORT=5432
ockam tcp-outlet create --to $PG_PORT
ockam relay create
```

<Alert status='info'>
   Relays make it possible to establish end-to-end protocols with services operating in a
   remote private networks, without requiring a remote service to expose listening ports to
   an outside hostile network like the Internet.
</Alert>

## Connecting the web app

Finally, let's setup a a local `tcp-inlet` to allow raw TCP traffic to be received on port
`5433` before it is forwarded.

```bash
export OCKAM_PORT=5433
ockam tcp-inlet create --from $OCKAM_PORT
```

<Alert status='info'>
A TCP inlet is a way to define where a node should be listening for connections, and where
it should forward that traffic to. An inlet and outlet work together to form a portal.
</Alert>

Start your web app again using the following command. And connect to this URL again from
your web browser `http://localhost:5000/` to see it running.

```bash
export APP_PG_PORT=$OCKAM_PORT
flask --app main run
```

1. Note that we have changed the `$APP_PG_PORT` to the same value as `$OCKAM_PORT`
   (`5433`). Our `main.py` script no longer longer has a direct connection to the unsecure
   database server (on port `5432`). It now goes through the secure channel 🔐.
2. The counter will continue incrementing just as it did before, with zero code changes to
   your application. But the web app is now communicating with the database through an Ockam
   secure channel 🎉.

## Multiple machines

You can also extend this example by moving the Postgres service into a Docker container
or to an entirely different machine. Once the nodes are registered the demo will continue
to work, with no application code changes and no need to expose the Postgres ports
directly to the Internet.

Also you can run the web app and the database on different machines.

1. You would have to change the `localhost` in the `main.py` script to the IP address of
   the machine where the database is running.
2. You would need to run `ockam enroll` on both machines (the web app machine and the
   database server machine).

## Other commands to explore

Now that you've completed this example, here are some commands for you to try and see what
they do. You can always look up the details on what they do in the
[manual](https://command.ockam.io/manual/). As you try each of these, please keep an eye
out for things you may have created in this exercise.

* Try `ockam node list`. Do you see the nodes that you created in this exercise?
* Try `ockam node --help`. These are shorter examples for you to get familiar with commands.
* Try `ockam node show web`. Do you see the `tcp-inlet` that you created in this exercise?
* Try `ockam node show db`. Do you see the `tcp-outlet` that you created in this exercise?
* Try `ockam identity list`. Do you see the identities you created in this exercise?
