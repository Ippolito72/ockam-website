Welcome to the first edition of Ockam's: The Razor üéâ

Before we kick things off though I've a few quick asks:

* **üíå Please reply to this email!** I'd love to hear any thoughts and feedback you 
have, but it's also just an easy way to get your mail provider to know this 
isn't spam and is actually something you've requested.
* **üó£Ô∏è Spread the word.** Please let any friends or colleagues that might be 
interested know that they should [sign up](https://www.ockam.io/the-razor).

Now on with the show...

## Secure-by-design

* **The Microsoft key acquisition breach:** they've published the [results of the 
investigation](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/09/results-of-major-technical-investigations-for-storm-0558-key-acquisition/) 
into how an attacker gained access to a key and was able to forge tokens to 
access OWA and Outlook.com. It's a fascinating look at how even some of the most 
well resourced companies is only as secure as its weakest link. Basically a 
crash dump failed to redact a secret, the dump file was then available in a 
debugging environment to assist in investigating the issue that caused the 
crash, and later a developer machine was compromised that allowed access to the 
debugging environment. Crashes by their nature can test the limits of expected 
behavior and this shows how a series of plausible scenarios that aren't 
sufficiently mitigated created a serious risk.
* Elixir is (still) safe: [A response](https://paraxial.io/blog/still-safe) from 
the Paraxial.io team to a research paper that was questioning the perception of 
Elixir as a "safe" language (note: Elixir is one of the major languages we use 
at Ockam, the other being Rust. Our CTO previously [published a post and 
webinar](https://www.ockam.io/blog/rewriting_in_rust) on why we rewrote our 
stack to be in Rust, in part for the safety improvements). I loved this 
particular quote: _"... then a paper is published saying, 'roads paved with 
Elixir still have potholes', ignoring that it results in fewer potholes"_. 
Perfect safety is always difficult to guarantee, but the tools we choose can 
definitely go a long way towards reducing the number of potholes we 
inadvertently create.
* **[RFC9420](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9420) was recently 
published by the IETF:** a draft years in the making for defining Messaging 
Layer Security (MLS) - think groups of users that want to send messages to each 
other. The [working group homepage](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks) gives 
a brief outline that's easier to digest than an RFC, but if audio and podcasts 
are more your style then Raphael Robert (co-author of the spec) was on the 
[Security Cryptography Whatever](https://securitycryptographywhatever.com/2023/04/22/mls/) 
podcast to talk about it.
* **A year of 0-days:** The Threat Analysis Group @ Google published their 
[year-in-review of 0-days exploited-in-the-wild](https://security.googleblog.com/2023/07/the-ups-and-downs-of-0-days-year-in.html) 
a few months ago - a near record year with 41 0-days detected and disclosed in 2022. The positive news in their takeaway was that they believe security 
improvements contributed to the 40% drop in exploits from the peak of 69 in 2021.
* **An exploit so old it could drink:** Matt Johansen talks us through [a backdoor in 
encrypted radio comms](https://twitter.com/mattjay/status/1684623084228136960?s=43) 
that has been in use for over 25 years. The Black Hat USA 2023 presentation he 
mentions was delivered last month, and the [slides are now available 
online](https://www.blackhat.com/us-23/briefings/schedule/#all-cops-are-broadcasting-breaking-tetra-after-decades-in-the-shadows-31807 ).

## DX

* **Fixing rough edges in Clang:** Peter Goodman from Trail of Bits [takes a deep 
dive](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/07/28/the-future-of-clang-based-tooling/) 
into what I'd consider some of the DX challenges of Clang as a compiler. If 
you're building C/C++/Objective-C apps it's worth a read as Peter has built some 
tooling to improve the experience and address the issues he points out, and 
mentions that DARPA (!!!) are helping to fund further improvements Trail of Bits 
are making towards compilers.
* **Application security through the lens of developer experience:** Peter Chan 
(ex VP of Information Security @ Netflix) takes a look at [the next evolution of 
AppSec](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/application-security-through-lens-developer-experience-jason-chan/). 
Including this üå∂Ô∏è take: _"AppSec teams have always meant well - we want to 
minimize risk to the organization and improve software quality. However, the 
way we‚Äôve traditionally worked has been completely antithetical to DevEx"_. He 
has a good explanation on why that's true though, go check it out.
* **To `stderr` or not to `stderr`:** that is the question! Or I guess it might be 
one `Sh4k3sp34r3` might pose if he were around today. I did ask something like 
it recently in an internal chat as I wasn't sure in which cases output went to 
`stdout` and when it went to `stderr`. Someone on the team helpfully pointed me 
towards the [CLI Guidelines](https://clig.dev) written by Aanand Prasad, Ben 
Firshman, Carl Tashian, and Eva Parish. In particular [the section on 
outputs](https://clig.dev/#output), TLDR; things you want to be able to pipe to 
another command or should be machine readable go to `stdout`, things you want to 
be displayed back to the user go to `stdout`.
* **Speaking of designing for the command line:** here's a flashback to the time 
Amanda Pinsker spoke about her experiences [helping design the GitHub 
CLI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjeZZVAk1E). It's a great introduction to 
and reminder of why people use CLI tools, and how you can provide great human 
experiences that enhance all of the reasons people use CLIs in the first place. 
I've always had a soft spot for well designed CLI tools as I think the 
constraints they impose forces an extra level of empathy for whoever is trying 
to use it, and so the ones that do it well just feel so natural to use. There's 
also a quick journey through some of the research and inspiration they took 
while designing their CLI, so if you're looking for inspiration or guidance for 
your own projects it's definitely worth a few minutes of your time.

## Product spotlight

* **CipherStash:** At Ockam we strongly believe that we need better tools and 
systems to protect data while it's in motion, and it's clear the team at 
[CipherStash](https://cipherstash.com) feel the same way. Messaging like 
"data doesn‚Äôt stay at rest. For data to be useful, it needs to be available" 
resonates so strongly! If you're using Postgres then their searchable encryption 
is an interesting (and complimentary) approach to securing the sensitive data 
you're storing in your database. If you're interested, submit your request for 
early access.

## The odd bits

* **Thanks, I hate it:** [here's a GitHub repo](https://github.com/mkrl/misbrands), 
called "misbrands", filled with logos that will make your eyes twitch just a 
little. Think VSCode but in the branding style of Vim, GitHub with the GitLab 
logo. There's quite a few in here that gave me a chuckle. I'm almost tempted to 
print some off to put on my laptop lid, they'd make a good conversation starter 
for anyone with a keen eye at the next conference I'm at.

That's it for this month! Once again, please let me know any feedback you have 
and spread the love.
