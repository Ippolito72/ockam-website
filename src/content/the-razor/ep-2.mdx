Here we are in October already! Hacktoberfest is in full swing and we've already
had [64 new people join people join us as contributors](https://twitter.com/mrinal/status/1716197909501534512). 
It's been amazing to watch. If you've ever wanted to make a contribution to 
a popular open source project, but didn't know how to begin, there's still
plenty of [issues to get started with](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+label%3Ahacktoberfest).

For now, on with the show&hellip;

## Secure-by-design

* **ü•∑ Hackers got into Okta:** Krebs has a story that explains how hackers
were able to use [customer cookies or session tokens that were shared in support
tickets](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/10/hackers-stole-access-tokens-from-oktas-support-unit/)
to then compromise customer's systems. Affected customers were notified &mdash; 
the reporting so far seems to suggest that customers noticed the attempts and 
were able to thwart them.
* **üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇ Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) with all the 
advisories:** It's been a busy month or so for CISA with a number a 
notices across a range of areas. First there's a report stating that [multiple 
nation-state threat actors have been exploiting known vulnerabilities], namely in
Zoho ManageEngine and FortiOS SSL-VPN. Next was a warning that [attackers could
modify router firmware without detection](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/cisa-nsa-fbi-and-japan-release-advisory-warning-blacktech-prc-linked-cyber-activity).
If you're working with OT or industrial systems you'll want to take a look
at their guidance for [Improving Open Source Software in Operational Technology
and Industrial Control Systems](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-10/Fact_Sheet_Improving_OSS_in_OT_ICS_508c.pdf).
Earlier this month they published their [Top 10 Cybersecurity Misconfigurations](https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/05/2003314578/-1/-1/0/JOINT_CSA_TOP_TEN_MISCONFIGURATIONS_TLP-CLEAR.PDF) 
&mdash; a list of expected things that people are still often getting wrong. 
This is why at Ockam thinks it's so critical to shift
towards building systems that are secure-by-design: it's time to stop hoping 
people will get every single security detail right, they need to be right
by default!
* **üîê Don't just take our word for it:** CISA are across this topic too: [Open
Source Software Must Start with Secure Code](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/open-source-software-must-start-secure-code).
* **üêù OWASP Top 10 for APIs:** The OWASP group published their list of [top 10
API security risks](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0x11-t10/)
and much like the CISA misconfigurations list it's a who's who of the same issues
plaguing the industry for a decade or more. 
* **üöó No privacy in your car:** Mozilla reviews 25 major card brands and
made the bold proclamation that they're all a [privacy nightmare on wheels](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/privacy-nightmare-on-wheels-every-car-brand-reviewed-by-mozilla-including-ford-volkswagen-and-toyota-flunks-privacy-test/).
Along with the privacy concerns they've raised about how manufacturers can
use/sell your data, not one of the brands reviewed met Mozilla's "Minimum 
Security Standards"! üò¨
* **üêü Wet wet wet:** This one is a bit of a throwback given it happened in 2018, but I 
thought it's a wonderful reminder that you're only ever as strong as your
weakest link. And apparently that weakest link can be an [IoT connected thermometer 
in a fish tank](https://thehackernews.com/2018/04/iot-hacking-thermometer.html).

## DX

* **üé® Add some color to your life:** [Flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki)
is _"an inky color scheme for prose and code"_. What does that actually mean? It 
means Steph took his years of experience of working with dyes and inks and 
applied it towards designing a syntax highlighting color scheme that's 
optimized for perceptual balance. He explains why replicating the way ink colors
mix in a digital medium is hard, and there's a link to a SIGGRAPH talk that
goes into even more detail. The results are beautiful! ü§© I've already switched 
my terminals and IDEs over.
* **üêö Need a new shell??** [Marcell is a shell](https://www.marceltheshell.org/).
It embraces the UNIX philosophy of using pipes as a form of composition, but
takes it a step further by returning Python values such as lists and tuples
rather than a text stream. Given how often I've found myself having to use 
`sed`, `cut`, `awk`, and/or `jq` to massage data into the form I need, this 
has me intrigued. Being able to manipulate outputs directly inline
with Python also has a certain appeal to it. However I've such a strong muscle memory
for my existing habits so I can't see myself changing to this as my
daily driver just yet. If you do take if for a spin please let me know how it
goes!

## Product spotlight

* **üßë‚Äçüç≥ What are we cooking up?** The team at Ockam have been working on 
something new, and we'll be ready to ship an early alpha version of it in the
next two weeks. If you're interested in taking it for a spin _and_ you're 
willing to record &amp; share with us a video of yourself trying it out (so that
we can see any UX issues you run into and fix them) please reply to this email
and let me know!
* **üìã Get compliant:** This looks early, but also interesting: 
[compliance.sh](https://compliance.sh/). If you've ever gone through the process
to get official recognition of the most common compliance frameworks (for example 
ISO27001, SOC2) then you'll know a lot of the work isn't fun. 
Compliance.sh claims to streamline this via the clever use of everyone's 
favorite buzzword&hellip; AI! The video on the homepage shows how it can help you 
generate policies that are aligned with multiple frameworks at the same time.
Neat!

## The odd bits

* **ü§ñ AI your shopping list:** While we're talking about AI, why not use it
to [make your next visit to the supermarket much more efficient](https://x.com/peternixey/status/1706660963045564421?s=20)?
* **üîè Unauthenticated signatures vs unauthenticated payloads:** [An example](https://mastodon.social/@kennwhite/111248292820347087) üòù
* **üî™ Respects to the OG:** I stumbled upon this much earlier edition of [The Razor&hellip;](https://www.sharpeninghandbook.info/Images/Knife_Sharpening_text.pdf)

That's it for this month. If you come across any interesting products you think
are worth sharing, a developer experience that got you excited, or just
want to compare notes on building secure systems please drop me a line.

Thanks,
